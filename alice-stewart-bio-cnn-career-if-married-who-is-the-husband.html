With the lessons she learned working under several politicians, she has pulled her strings and is currently a political commentator on CNN.</p><p>As we all know, political talks at times could perfectly bore anyone, having worked with a few politicians, Stewart kind of has her way of dicing each story and talks in a simple perfect gist. With her, political commentaries are quite interesting. Her numerous works with CNN are not practically streamlined on any records, however, watching her on television shows indicates that she sure handles her job perfectly. It is no surprise as she holds an Emmy-Award for her excellence.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=alice-stewart-%e2%80%93-bio></span><strong>Alice Stewart – Bio</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The daughter of the senior vice president for corporate affairs at Squibb Corporation was born on July 4, 1966. Her mom was a biology teacher at Columbia High School Maplewood, New Jersey. Both names of her parents are still unraveled, but we know that she is the only known child of her parents. Also, there is a dearth of information regarding the particular details of her formative years.</p><p>As regarding her educational details, Alice Stewart schooled at Tucker High School. She subsequently bagged a degree in political science and government from the University of Georgia.</p><p>After graduating from school, the lady kicked off her career with MTV News working as the segment producer. Her job description with the organization was basically for reporting and production of news. She was amongst the team that worked for MTV’s Choose or Lose campaign that covered the 1992 presidential race. As a result of her diligence and excellence that period, she bagged a Peabody award. Alice Stewart consistency and loyalty with MTV in the following years are regarded as one of her early works in broadcasting.</p><p>After she left MTV, Alice joined CBS News and with the team, she worked as a reporter and hosted several shows and programs. Later in her early days, she went ahead to work with several other television and radio stations such as ABC, MNSBC, and the rest of them.</p><p>Shortly after she turned her back on broadcasting, Alice Stewart began working for the then Arkansas governor, Mike Huckabee as his press secretary. She was amazing at her job and subsequently played as the press secretary for the governor’s 2008 presidential campaign.</p><p>Then in the 2012 presidential cycle, the then press secretary for the Arkansas governor began to work for Michele Bachman in the same stead. After the campaign ended, she was recruited by Rick Santorum. With the end of the campaign, she subsequently hired by Mitt Romney to work as his surrogate.</p><p>In 2016, Alice Stewart worked under Mike Huckabee again as his communication director. Meanwhile, the then press secretary had joined a nonprofit organization just before her appointment with Huckabee. She later left the ex-governor campaign group that same year.</p><p>Stewart went ahead to join Senator Ted Cruz’s campaign organization in 2016 serving as the national spokeswoman and senior adviser. She subsequently transited into being his communication director. Unfortunately, with Ted Cruz’s loss of the Republican party ticket to then-candidate Donald Trump, Stewart joined CNN.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cnn-career></span><strong>CNN Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Having been groomed with the different political team she had worked for, Alice Stewart joined CNN as their political commentator in 2016. There are no particular details about her deals with CNN, however, she has oftentimes appeared as a Republican-side analyst on the broadcasting station.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=if-married-who-is-the-husband></span><strong> If Married Who Is The Husband?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Love is often times expressed as one of the most beautiful things we share as humans. Some have experienced it, while others have shielded their hearts from experiencing it, maybe cos of their hurtful past. For Alice Stewart, it is quite surprising that a woman with so much poise and a fulfilling career has no man clung to her.</p><p>This is rather inconclusive as the political commentator has never revealed any of her past relationships to the limelight. She has kept the affairs of her love life under wraps. More so, no one knows the precise status of her sexual orientation and many hope that she would someday open up about this aspect of her life. Till Alice Stewart is ready to tell us about her love life, we rather say that the political commentator is currently assumed single.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmcnrCmedKtnLCZoql6o7XOZpqnpl2YrrOxxKtkop5doq6zvsiem2avmKR6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZZiqwKOtzZ1m</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2falice-stewart-bio-cnn-career-if-married-who-is-the-husband.html&text=Alice%20Stewart%20%20Bio%2c%20CNN%20Career%2c%20If%20Married%20Who%20Is%20The%20Husband%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falice-stewart-bio-cnn-career-if-married-who-is-the-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2falice-stewart-bio-cnn-career-if-married-who-is-the-husband.html&title=Alice%20Stewart%20%20Bio%2c%20CNN%20Career%2c%20If%20Married%20Who%20Is%20The%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2falice-stewart-bio-cnn-career-if-married-who-is-the-husband.html&title=Alice%20Stewart%20%20Bio%2c%20CNN%20Career%2c%20If%20Married%20Who%20Is%20The%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2falice-stewart-bio-cnn-career-if-married-who-is-the-husband.html&title=Alice%20Stewart%20%20Bio%2c%20CNN%20Career%2c%20If%20Married%20Who%20Is%20The%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falice-stewart-bio-cnn-career-if-married-who-is-the-husband.html&description=Alice%20Stewart%20%20Bio%2c%20CNN%20Career%2c%20If%20Married%20Who%20Is%20The%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./807525-eric-bishcoff-discusses-his-friendship-with-teddy-long-working-with-him-in-wcw-teddys-wwe-hall-of-fame-induction-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eric Bischoff Talks His Friendship w/ Teddy Long, Working w/ Him In WCW, Teddys WWE HOF Induction">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./wiu-quad-cities-supports-more-small-businesses.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="WIU Quad Cities supports more small businesses">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
