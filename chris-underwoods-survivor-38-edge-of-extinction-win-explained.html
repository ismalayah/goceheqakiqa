Season 38 featured the “Edge of Extinction” twist, and the then-25-year-old player took full advantage of it.</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>So, what happened with Chris during his campaign to receive $1 million, and how does it relate to his current position on USA 2? Let’s get into it!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Chris was the third person voted off of Survivor 38 and he lost the first battle-back challenge</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=678 data-injectable=true>https://youtu.be/fpf-gHekZ7A?si=ZI2_6ISaIF-yMYuv</figure><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>Chris joined 14 new players and four returning veterans for the 38th iteration of Survivor’s US-based version. Two tribes had been assembled to begin the game which featured seven rookies and two returnees apiece.</p><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>Chris was part of the “Manu” alongside two-time Survivor contestant Kelley Wentworth, Millenials vs. Gen X favorite David Wright, and fellow newbie Dan “Wardog” DaSilva.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false>Players became aware of the season’s theme that allowed them to make a decision after they had been voted off: they could head back to a life of comfort, or they could make their way to the Edge of Extinction — a desolate island that was anything but comfortable.</p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>Further, they knew if they embraced the Edge of Extinction they’d have the opportunity to fight their way back into the game at some point. But, the details given by host Jeff Probst were limited.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>Well, unfortunately for Manu, they lost the first three immunity challenges. After helping vote out Reem Daly and Keith Sowell, Chris found himself on the wrong side of a blindside on day 9. While preparing for their third straight Tribal Council, Chris launched an assault on Kelley — a player known for their strategic prowess.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>He tried to rally votes against Wentworth by enlisting the likes of David and Wardog. But, the San Juan del Sur and Cambodia alum became privy to Chris’ crusade. And in true veteran fashion, Wentworth formed a counterattack that ultimately sealed his fate.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>Besides Wendy Diaz, every other player wrote Chris’ name down, and Probst snuffed his torch. Confused and heartbroken, Chris sailed off to his new home: the Edge of Extinction. And to make matters worse, he was greeted by two players he helped eliminate, Reem and Keith.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>“I didn’t want to be here,” Chris said at the Edge of Extinction. “But, I am. It’s like voluntary torture. I’m stuck on an island with two people that are pissed at me. I’ve got nothing but myself.”</p><p data-characters=102 data-current-count=102 data-injectable=false>Chris also opened up about his shaken mindset, and how his prior Survivor expectations were shattered.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>“It’s really hard being out here,” he continued. “A lot of my fears are starting to come out. I’ve got a fear of failure, need for approval — like, just trying to be perfect. Just this perfectionist. And all of those fears happened. I failed. Like, it got me voted out. This idea of playing a perfect game is completely shot.</p><p data-characters=92 data-current-count=92 data-injectable=false>“So, coming to terms with that, maybe that’s a part of this journey, too.”</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>Three more individuals eventually joined them on Edge of Extinction. And before the battle-back challenge, the voted-off players had opportunities to earn advantages.</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>Chris received bamboo and string, tools that allowed him to practice a portion of the impending challenge.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>But, unfortunately for Chris, Keith came back to haunt him. Keith had also earned an advantage; he had the power to assign one player 30 extra knots to untie during the final part of the challenge. And he gave the honors to Chris, somewhat nullifying Chris’ advantage.</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=182 data-injectable=false>As history has it, Chris was inches away from getting back into the game but his ball dropped at the end, making way for Chris’ former tribemate Rick Devens to seal the deal.</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>Once the dust settled and Chris’ dream of returning to the game had been crushed (he thought, at least) he shared his self-reflection about his idealization of playing a “perfect game.”</p><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=858 data-injectable=true>“When I came out here, I wanted to play this perfect game, and have that slip through my hands and having to embrace that, and understand like, you can’t be perfect,” a teary-eyed Chris said thinking he was about to be sent home. “You’re gonna screw up. But, being out there with these guys, you didn’t have to put on this face. You didn’t have to fake anything. You could just be yourself, and it was like therapy for me.”</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>Well, to the five outcasts’ delight, Jeff then revealed that they could return to the Edge of Extinction and await another shot at redemption. And unsurprisingly, Chris and the rest of the gamers accepted the offer instantly.</p><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>So, Chris headed back to the island — something that proved to be a $1-million decision.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Chris became the ‘Sole Survivor’ after winning the final redemption competition and throwing himself into harm’s way</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>As Chris called “buyers’ remorse,” Keith and Wendy both elected to raise the sail immediately after returning to the Edge of Extinction.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>So, he, Reem, and two-time Survivor player Aubry Bracco were left alone on the island while they awaited another comeback opportunity. They were also a part of the jury — another twist — so, they also attended the Tribal Councils moving forward.</p><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=104 data-injectable=false>All in all, eight more competitors joined them on Edge of Extinction before the final battle-back game.</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>And this time, Chris came out on top and redeemed himself by finishing the challenge first. After spending more than two dozen days out of the game, Chris was instantly placed into the top 6.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>“When Jeff called my name out, honestly, I was in shock,” Chris said after winning the challenge. “It was my 28th day on the Edge of Extinction. This is the most excited and nervous I’ve been out here. And now I am going to do everything in my power to win this game.”</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>Well, Chris immediately went to work reconnecting with Rick, someone who voted him out originally but, like him, returned from the Edge of Extinction. In the next two Tribal Councils, Chris convinced Lauren O’Connell to play a hidden immunity idol on him, and then he played another one on himself during the top 5.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>After finding himself as part of the final 4, Chris won the last immunity challenge of Survivor 38. But, knowing he had to continue to bolster his resume, Chris chose to make an extremely risky move — something that definitely paid dividends.</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=346 data-injectable=false>Ahead of the fire-making challenge that’d round out the final three players who’d address the jury and contend for the $1 million, Chris chose to give his immunity necklace to Julie Rosenberg and battle Rick. At this point, Rick was the biggest threat left to win the game, and Chris knew he had to take the shot to impress the jury.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>“I came into this game wanting to have no regrets,” Chris said to Jeff at Tribal. “And I wouldn’t want there to be any other way for this season to end. It’s the biggest risk I’m taking.”</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>Well, Chris’ move paid off. He defeated Devens which earned him a spot at the final Tribal Council alongside Julie and Gavin Whitson. And after waiting around a year for the live finale, Chris was crowned the Edge of Extinction’s winner by receiving nine votes from the jury.</p><h2 id=h-chris-knows-playing-the-perfect-game-isn-t-possible-and-it-appears-he-s-embraced-the-struggle-on-the-challenge-usa data-injectable=false>Chris knows playing the ‘perfect game’ isn’t possible, and it appears he’s embraced the struggle on The Challenge USA</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=103 data-injectable=false><strong>The following section contains spoilers for the episodes aired thus far on </strong><strong>The Challenge: USA </strong><strong>season 2.</strong></p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>Well, Chris had to lean into the lessons he learned living on the Edge of Extinction and rely on them during USA 2. Like Edge of the Extinction, The Challenge allows contestants to fight for their life in the game.</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>Virtually every season of the show has held elimination rounds for voted-in players to compete in loser-go-home challenges.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>After receiving anonymous votes that were sent into “The Hopper,” Chris found himself in the second male “Arena” of the season opposite The Amazing Race star Luis Colon. It was a highly physical competition that forced them to wrestle a disk away from each other. And like his time on Survivor, Chris dug deep and kept his game alive.</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>When Chris returned to the Challenge house, he called out those who were against him, like Big Brother’s Tyler Crispen and Monte Taylor, saying he was going to “take all you b*tches out.”</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>“This is not Big Brother,” Chris said, referring to the fact that someone doesn’t just leave if they receive votes. They can avoid elimination, return, and gun for those in charge of throwing them into the sand.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>“Take it as you want: I’m either the best player ever or the worst player ever,” Chris said in a confessional on August 24’s episode. “After Survivor, articles were written about me that I was the most undeserving winner to ever play Survivor because I lost — got voted out.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=178 data-injectable=false>“I was able to make my way back into the game and win that $1 million prize. And so, if you vote me in, you better buckle up because I’m here to win this game.”</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>Well, later that episode Chris found himself standing beside host TJ Lavin in the Arena once again. The Green Team, which Tyler and Monte were a part of, won the daily challenge and they piled their votes onto Chris. Luckily for the Survivor champ, a male name wasn’t chosen by The Hopper and he rejoined his Blue crew.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=247 data-injectable=false>So, how will Chris’ Challenge journey go, and will he join the handful of reality television stars who’ve won two major competition shows? Only time will tell! USA 2 is currently airing Sundays and Thursdays on CBS and Paramount Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yktNGiqmatnpmys8POqJusZaOqv7e11aipZmtoYrKls8Rmpp9lla3BqrrCraCopl2stq95xLGnpZmZo7Klew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchris-underwoods-survivor-38-edge-of-extinction-win-explained.html&text=Chris%20Underwoods%20Survivor%2038%3a%20Edge%20of%20Extinction%20win%2c%20explained&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchris-underwoods-survivor-38-edge-of-extinction-win-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchris-underwoods-survivor-38-edge-of-extinction-win-explained.html&title=Chris%20Underwoods%20Survivor%2038%3a%20Edge%20of%20Extinction%20win%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchris-underwoods-survivor-38-edge-of-extinction-win-explained.html&title=Chris%20Underwoods%20Survivor%2038%3a%20Edge%20of%20Extinction%20win%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchris-underwoods-survivor-38-edge-of-extinction-win-explained.html&title=Chris%20Underwoods%20Survivor%2038%3a%20Edge%20of%20Extinction%20win%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchris-underwoods-survivor-38-edge-of-extinction-win-explained.html&description=Chris%20Underwoods%20Survivor%2038%3a%20Edge%20of%20Extinction%20win%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-avatar-roku-and-who-plays-him-in-netflixs-avatar-the-last-airbender.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Avatar Roku and who plays him in Netflixs Avatar: The Last Airbender?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./taxi-marilu-henner-now-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="See Taxi Star Marilu Henner Now at 69  Best Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
