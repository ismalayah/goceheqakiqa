She was born in the United States and clearly holds American nationality. Another very obvious fact about Amanda Martin is her Caucasian ethnicity.</p><p>Her mother is Sandi Klapp Nafziger, and her father was Zachariah J. Keathley Jr. Born in 1920, Zachariah was a World War II veteran. Sadly, he died of age-related issues on November 1, 2006, at the ripe old age of 86 years.</p><p>Amanda’s entrepreneurial spirit is a branch off of her father’s brave legacy. The 50-year-old Capricorn zodiac member has two siblings, both born into her parents’ union. They are Zack Keathley (brother) and sisters Sandra and Wendi Blank.</p><p>Amanda’s educational background is not very well documented, but she did receive the basics. The reality television actress attended the neighborly Red Oak High School in Texas. She proceeded to an unknown college in America, but whatever she studied there has not been made public.</p><h2><strong>Amanda Martin’s Work Life Began in the Banking Industry</strong></h2><p>Before Amanda Martin decided to become the face of Iron Resurrection, she was once a corporate worker – and worked in the financial industry as a banker. Amanda worked in the banking industry for several years and landed her first job straight out of college.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/5bd872ffabde8659-1.jpg alt="Amanda Martin" width=696 height=465 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Her first banking job was as an employee of the American multinational financial company Wells Fargo. She worked with Wells Fargo for four years, beginning in March 2007 and lasting until December 2011. During those four years, Amanda rose in ranks from a simple clerk to becoming the Branch Manager of the bank and later Vice President.</p><p>In 2012, Amanda got another job with Pioneer Bank. There, she held a number of different positions, starting from Assistant Vice President to the Deposit Operations Vice President and then a Product Manager. She was still in that position when she decided to quit the industry entirely.</p><h3><strong>She Left the Bank to Become a Reality TV Star on Her Husband’s Show</strong></h3><p>Amanda Martin left the financial sector to become part of her husband’s (Joe Martin) business and TV show. Now, she is a co-owner of the automobile refurbishing and customization company Martin Bros Customs, along with her husband.</p><p>She also became a television star after their automobile business was chosen by Discovery Channel to be filmed in a reality television show titled Iron Resurrection. Amanda and her husband are co-stars on the show, which has been rated by many as one of the best automobile shows on television.</p><p>On the show, Joe, Amanda, and other castmates search the Texas countryside for old, broken-down motorcycles and cars they can fix and make brand new again. Joe, unlike his wife, has been in the automobile business for many years and has been fascinated with cars since childhood.</p><p>The first three seasons of the show were an immense success. Martin Bros Customs’ popularity has soared to the extent that they not only earned very handsomely but also owned several branded merchandise, including shirts and baseball caps. There are currently speculations over the return of the show for a fourth installment.</p><h2><strong>Amanda Martin and Joe Martin Are Happily Married</strong></h2><p>Amanda Martin is happily married to Joe Martin – and honestly, why wouldn’t she be? Her decision to trust her husband and switch careers has proven to be one of the most financially beneficial decisions she might have made in her life.</p><p>Amanda and Joe became man and wife several years ago. The pair are yet to reveal the exact date of their wedding to the public. Joe Martin was born on April 16, 1969, in Chicago, Illinois. He is a mechanic and an avid lover of automobiles.</p><p>Joe was the winner of the Discovery Channel’s reality show, Biker Build-Off. So he already had reality television experience before he launched their own reality show. Amanda and Joe own a company together called Martin Bros Company.</p><p>Although Joe and Amanda have been married for years, they do not yet have any children. Any change in this situation will be updated as necessary. The Martins currently reside in Johnson City, Texas, with their dogs.</p><h2><strong>Is Amanda Martin Still on Iron Resurrection?</strong></h2><p>Presently, there have been no new episodes of Iron Resurrection since early 2022. There were talks about the show’s fourth season beginning on September 27, 2022, but even now, the fourth season hasn’t been aired. Amanda has been a regular cast member of the show since it began in 2016, and it has yet to be ascertained whether that will change anytime soon. Presently, she is still considered a cast member of the show.</p><h2><strong>What Happened to Amanda Martin?</strong></h2><p>Nothing bad or fatal has happened to Joe Martin’s wife, contrary to rumors. In fact, any rumors that suggest a mishap has occurred are nothing but click baits. Amanda appears to be filming for the show’s fifth season with her husband and the rest of the crew.</p><p>While a fourth season has not been aired, it seems like filming has since been completed, and the Martins are only waiting for the go-ahead from Discovery Channel. Finally, Amanda Martin did not drown, nor is she dead. The former banking executive and TV personality are alive and well.</p><h2><strong>Quick Facts About Amanda Martin</strong></h2><li><strong>Who is Amanda Martin?</strong> Amanda Martin is a former banking executive, reality television star, and successful businesswoman.
