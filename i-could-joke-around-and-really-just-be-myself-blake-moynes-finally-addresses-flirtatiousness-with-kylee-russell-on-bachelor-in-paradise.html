With the relationship between Blake and Jess officially over, the former knew that he would not find another connection during his time on Bachelor In Paradise, making the decision to leave the beach once and for all.</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=161 data-injectable=false>Afterwards, Kylee Russell chased after Blake Moynes and practically begged for him to stay, causing fans of The Bachelor franchise to raise their eyebrows…</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>Given the limited amount of interactions Blake and Kylee had with one another all season long, Bachelor In Paradise viewers were extremely confused by this encounter, taking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> to share their thoughts.</p><p>“Okay no one is talking about this, but can we PLEASE discuss the tension. Even if Kylee isn’t deliberately flirting, Blake is just really obviously trying not to flirt. Like, when he left last episode and she asked him if there was anyone he would stay there for and he gave that quick look up and down and laughed it off, and this episode he comes back and Aven clearly looks uncomfortable during the whole thing because Kylee is intensely excited… Am I the only one who sees it?”</p><p data-characters=72 data-current-count=72 data-injectable=false>The original post garnered 15 comments, many of which were in agreement.</p><p>“I think Kylee was secretly into Blake, but he was over Jess the whole time. Then finally when they broke up, Kylee just didn’t wanna look bad on TV to jump ship.”</p><p>“Me too!! And the way the other girls were like ‘Kylee! Kylee! Blake is here! It’s Blake!’ It’s like the one who got away returned. She definitely was more upbeat speaking with Blake than with Aven the whole time in Paradise.”</p><p>“So glad I’m not the only one who peeped that!! Kylee clearly isn’t into Aven. When she pulled Blake aside the last episode, she was using that opportunity to see if Blake was interested. If I was part of Aven’s family I would tell him DROP THAT B***H. That weird comment she made about ‘There’s no one here you would stay for?’ was not cool. I’d be humiliated if I was Aven.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>With dozens and dozens of rumors flying around, Blake Moynes himself spilled the tea to fans of The Bachelor franchise during an episode of the Off The Vine Podcast hosted by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaitlyn Bristowe</a>.</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>When asked about his encounter with Kylee during his self-elimination, Blake admitted that he was just as thrown off as we were, as they were just extremely close friends throughout Bachelor In Paradise season 9.</p><p>“I think that I gravitate to a few of the girls on that beach in the sense that there were a few really close to Jess… You know when you can just be so close to and make girl friends really quickly when like you’re with one of their best friends, and so you can gravitate, tell them anything, and be super close with them? That’s what basically developed with Kylee, even Mercedes there, and Kat, where I just felt that there were safe spaces where I could joke around and really just be myself with them, and so we were able to create really great relationships where it just felt natural.”</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=166 data-injectable=false>While that is how Blake viewed his relationship with Kylee, he admitted that he cannot speak on her behalf, saying that the conversation itself was rather confusing.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=false>With both Blake Moynes and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kylee Russell being #SingleAF</a> now that Bachelor In Paradise season 9 has come to a close, could the pair reconnect in the near future? It is safe to say we will be keeping up with both Blake and Kylee on Instagram until further notice!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqecKorKWcXZ%2B8rLGMmqmorZ6ZeqK6w2apnpmcocZuttSsq2aalWK6ur%2FEpZ1mmpyWuKZ5zKiwp52jYrOqusClo7JlkZmxs7HSrJysZZahtrPAwK2gqK2jo7K0v4ywoK2gXaDGrbHEZqmuq6Oaua15zqdkm5mTnbKtu9FmoKdloJa%2ForDIrJxo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fi-could-joke-around-and-really-just-be-myself-blake-moynes-finally-addresses-flirtatiousness-with-kylee-russell-on-bachelor-in-paradise.html&text=I%20could%20joke%20around%20and%20really%20just%20be%20myself%3a%20Blake%20Moynes%20finally%20addresses%20flirtatiousness%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-could-joke-around-and-really-just-be-myself-blake-moynes-finally-addresses-flirtatiousness-with-kylee-russell-on-bachelor-in-paradise.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-could-joke-around-and-really-just-be-myself-blake-moynes-finally-addresses-flirtatiousness-with-kylee-russell-on-bachelor-in-paradise.html&title=I%20could%20joke%20around%20and%20really%20just%20be%20myself%3a%20Blake%20Moynes%20finally%20addresses%20flirtatiousness%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fi-could-joke-around-and-really-just-be-myself-blake-moynes-finally-addresses-flirtatiousness-with-kylee-russell-on-bachelor-in-paradise.html&title=I%20could%20joke%20around%20and%20really%20just%20be%20myself%3a%20Blake%20Moynes%20finally%20addresses%20flirtatiousness%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fi-could-joke-around-and-really-just-be-myself-blake-moynes-finally-addresses-flirtatiousness-with-kylee-russell-on-bachelor-in-paradise.html&title=I%20could%20joke%20around%20and%20really%20just%20be%20myself%3a%20Blake%20Moynes%20finally%20addresses%20flirtatiousness%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-could-joke-around-and-really-just-be-myself-blake-moynes-finally-addresses-flirtatiousness-with-kylee-russell-on-bachelor-in-paradise.html&description=I%20could%20joke%20around%20and%20really%20just%20be%20myself%3a%20Blake%20Moynes%20finally%20addresses%20flirtatiousness%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./star-trek-legend-jonathan-frakes-weighs-future-franchise.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jonathan Frakes Wants Quentin Tarantinos Star Trek Movie To Happen">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./antonio-ibanez.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Antonio Ibez- Wiki, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Ethncity">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
