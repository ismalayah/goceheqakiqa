So they relied heavily on body language for performers to communicate things. But unlike the vaudeville-type acts you’d see on stage at the time, silent movies could get right in tight on a person’s face, where the most subtle and expressive movements of a person’s face could be captured and projected for all to see, as if they were right next to the person.</description></item><item><title>Fans Compare The Suspension Of Marcell Ozuna Over Domestic Violence With Trevor Bauer</title><link>/fans-compare-the-suspension-of-marcell-ozuna-over-domestic-violence-with-trevor-bauer.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/fans-compare-the-suspension-of-marcell-ozuna-over-domestic-violence-with-trevor-bauer.html</guid><description>Marcell Ozuna Suspension became a great deal for the rest of the players from all spectrum.

Alex also has a code of honor, as we see when he, in a rare moment of silence, clams up after his never-named mom (Denise Gough) asks why he didn't tell the school's out-of-touch principal (Noma Dumezweni, doing a fine job in another pivotal but unnamed role) that he’s being bullied.</description></item><item><title>Where does Stephen King live?</title><link>/where-does-stephen-king-live.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/where-does-stephen-king-live.html</guid><description>Specializing in all things, spooky, scary, and supernatural, acclaimed author and shade-thrower at Republicans Stephen King is rightfully considered by many to be one of the greatest horror writers of all time.
