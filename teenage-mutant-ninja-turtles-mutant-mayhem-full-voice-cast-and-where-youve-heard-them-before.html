The animated movie, based on the classic Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird characters, was announced in 2020 and is the directorial debut of Jeff Rowe. The movie is the first animated entry into the series since the 2007 TMNT, which was derided by critics and fans alike for a lackluster plot and bad writing. The latest entry into the series is shifting gears and aims to focus on the “teenage” aspect of the turtles a bit more heavily. The move could be just what the franchise needs to dust off the dirt from its explosive time under Michael Bay.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>Giving the Turtles the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man: Homecoming</a> treatment could help the series reach a broader audience while still letting the turtles kick butt all through New York. With the new approach Nickelodeon has cast a slew of young actors to fill the shoes of the band of brothers, not to worry however, the voice talent behind the beloved characters has plenty of experience despite their youth and the studio has brought on massive talent to help fill in the gaps.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Leonardo – Nicolas Cantu</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TMNT-LEonardo.jpg><p data-characters=765 data-current-count=1065 data-injectable=true>Nicolas Cantu may not be a name you’re overly familiar with, but the young actor has been lending his voice to characters for years. Cantu’s best-known performance was as the voice of Gumball Waterson, the main character of the Cartoon Network series The Amazing World of Gumball. Cantu filled the role from 2011 to 2019, while simultaneously playing Prince James in Disney plus’s series, Sofia the First (2016- 2018). His acting credits extend to the television screen, with the actor having appeared in several live-action shows, including AMC’s The Walking Dead and The Good Place. The 19-year-old is taking a step back from acting these days, only signing onto the projects he’s really interested in while he navigates his way through young adulthood.</p><h2 id=h-michelangelo-shamon-brown-jr data-injectable=false>Michelangelo – Shamon Brown Jr</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TMNT-Michalangelo.jpg><p data-characters=575 data-current-count=875 data-injectable=true>Shamon Brown Jr. is the least experienced actor in the cast. Although the 18-year-old has just one role listed on his IMDB, the actor has been in print ads for years. His single credit comes from the Showtime coming of age drama, The Chi. Brown plays Stanley “Papa” Jackson, a breakout character from the show’s second season. The character quickly became a fan favorite, even among adults. Brown was 12 when he first appeared on the show, and the actor has been infinitely grateful to his supporters for pushing for his character to become a part of the main cast.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Donatello – Micah Abbey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TMNT-Donetello.jpg><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>Micah Abbey is the youngest member of the announced cast. The 15-year-old has been acting since before he was 10. While he only has a few screen credits under his belt, the young actor has proven his ability to carry a scene with his stint on Grey’s Anatomy.&nbsp;He played Leaf, one of two leading roles in the series Cousins for Life for the show’s limited run.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Raphael – Brady Noon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tmnt-Raphael.jpg><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=819 data-injectable=true>The final turtle brother is being portrayed by Brady Noon. The actor has been in several movies and TV shows and played a young Tommy Darmody on the HBO drama <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Boardwalk Empire</a> alongside his identical twin, Connor Noon. He also had a starring role in The Might Ducks: Game Changers and flexed his comedic muscles as Thor Miller in the 2019 raunchy comedy Good Boys. He’s lent his voice to several projects in the past including Diary of A Wimpy Kid and Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Roderick Rules as the main character, Greg.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Splinter – Jackie Chan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/tmnt-Splinter.jpg><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=748 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jackie Chan</a> is a cultural icon.

The actress is a long-time comedian in Hollywood. Though she has worked on a number of projects as both actor and writer, her most prominent role to date has been assuming the role of Missy Foreman-Greenwald in Netflix’s raunchy comedy Big Mouth. She picked up the mantle after the series felt the role would come across better if Missy were portrayed by a black actress, a move which most people applauded. She has also appeared in Mel Brooks History of the World, Part II and is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to be cast</a> in the upcoming Thunderbolts movie.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Bebop – Seth Rogan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TMNT-Bebop.jpg><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=707 data-injectable=true>Comedy powerhouse Seth Rogan isn’t just the talent, the actor is also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the producers</a> behind the project.

Cena has provided the voice on several projects over the years including a stint in the 2018 Rise of the TMNT series as the villainous Draxum. His first voice role came way back in 2014 with Scooby-Doo WrestleMania Mystery in which he played himself.

She’s best known for her work in the Insidious series as Renai Lambert, X-men: First Class as Moira MacTaggert and Bridesmaids as Helen Harris III.

The actress got her start back in 2012 but her most recognized role is that of Nadja in the vampire comedy, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">What We Do in the Shadows</a>. Demetriou hasn’t done much in the way of voice work, but the actress did lend her voice to Cala Maria in The Cuphead Show.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Superfly – Ice Cube</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/super-fly-tmnt.jpg><p data-characters=799 data-current-count=1099 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IceCube</a> is another name on this list with some serious tenure in the entertainment industry. Starting his career as a rapper along side Eazy-E and Dr. Dre, Cube has been credited with penning most of the lyrics for “Straight Outta Compton,” the trio’s signature N.W.A. song. Ice Cube would eventually leave the group to focus on his solo career, which allowed him the freedom to fill the role of Darin “Doughboy” Baker in Boyz n the Hood. Despite his knack for drama and a seemingly endless well of anger to pull from, Cube consistently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fell back on comedy roles</a> for years, and has starred in several children’s movies. The talented actor has lent his voice to several productions, including the Book of Life 2 as the Candlemaker, and as Joseph Bowman in Call of Duty: Black Ops.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Baxter Stockman – Giancarlo Esposito</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Baxter-stockman-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles.jpg><p data-characters=621 data-current-count=921 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Giancarlo Esposito</a> has been acting since 1970, but the 64-year-old found mainstream success in his portrayal of Gus Fring, the enigmatic villain in AMC’s Breaking Bad. In recent years he has breathed life into characters like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Moff Gideon</a> in The Mandalorian and Congressman Adam Clayton Powell in Godfather of Harlem. Esposito’s long tenure in the business has given the actor plenty of time to find voice work and he has lent his dulcet tones to Faraday in Netflix’s Cyberpunk: Edge Runners, “El Presidente” Anton Castillo in the Far Cry 6 video game, and Akela in Disney’s The Jungle Book live-action remake.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq56dnpa0pnnMrquapqRiu6q6yZpkra2iqbmmv4ymrK2Znql6rq3YoZymZZaqua151aignJ1dmK60wIyapZ1lp52ys7GMsqaurpVitaat0Z1kraCVonqjscWoqZ5n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fteenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-full-voice-cast-and-where-youve-heard-them-before.html&text=Teenage%20Mutant%20Ninja%20Turtles%3a%20Mutant%20Mayhem%20full%20voice%20cast%20and%20where%20youve%20heard%20them%20befo&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fteenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-full-voice-cast-and-where-youve-heard-them-before.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fteenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-full-voice-cast-and-where-youve-heard-them-before.html&title=Teenage%20Mutant%20Ninja%20Turtles%3a%20Mutant%20Mayhem%20full%20voice%20cast%20and%20where%20youve%20heard%20them%20befo" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fteenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-full-voice-cast-and-where-youve-heard-them-before.html&title=Teenage%20Mutant%20Ninja%20Turtles%3a%20Mutant%20Mayhem%20full%20voice%20cast%20and%20where%20youve%20heard%20them%20befo" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fteenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-full-voice-cast-and-where-youve-heard-them-before.html&title=Teenage%20Mutant%20Ninja%20Turtles%3a%20Mutant%20Mayhem%20full%20voice%20cast%20and%20where%20youve%20heard%20them%20befo" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fteenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-full-voice-cast-and-where-youve-heard-them-before.html&description=Teenage%20Mutant%20Ninja%20Turtles%3a%20Mutant%20Mayhem%20full%20voice%20cast%20and%20where%20youve%20heard%20them%20befo" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./best-female-nerds-in-anime.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The top 7 best female nerds in anime">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jim-lico-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jim Lico Net Worth  Phone Number, House Address, Wiki">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
