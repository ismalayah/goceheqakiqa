At the recently held awards event, Kimmel took his gag way too far when he continued his pretending-to-be-unconscious act even when Quinta Brunson was giving her acceptance speech after winning for writing the pilot episode of the popular series Abbott Elementary.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>People have been rightfully chiding Kimmel for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stealing Quinta’s spotlight</a>, who is only the second Black Woman to win the prestigious award. While the writer-actor has been very gracious and forgiving towards Kimmel’s antics, the internet has not been able to gulp down how unnecessary and annoying it was that the host dragged his “bit.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>But this is nothing new for the host as one look at Kimmel’s history is enough to establish that he has a way of landing himself in the hot seat of controversies.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-when-jimmy-kimmel-mocked-nba-star-karl-malone-with-a-blackface data-injectable=false>When Jimmy Kimmel mocked NBA star Karl Malone with a blackface</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=736 data-injectable=true>Kimmel’s time on the highly controversial The Man Show, which ran from 1999 to 2004, remains the most contentious phase of his life. Wrapping insane levels of sexism in layers of satire, the host indulged in everything from groping women to openly objectifying them and whatnot. Though Kimmel has left the stage of the show years ago, his not-so-hilarious jokes haven’t aged well and still attract biting criticism for the comedian.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>But what actually put him on the radar of the rampant cancel culture was the resurfaced clips of his recurring sketches from the show wherein he tried to imitate NBA legend Karl Malone by wearing blackface. This took place in 2020, right when it was announced that Kimmel would be hosting the Emmy Awards. His taking the summer off at the time only added fuel to the fire, prompting the host to break his silence and extend a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">long overdue apology</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jimmy Kimmel's Karl Malone sketch wasn't merely offensive due to blackface.</p><p>It's the voice / speech patterns.</p><p>Can one of you supercut geniuses like <a href=#>@greg_price11</a> compare Kimmel's impersonation of Malone with how Malone actually speaks?</p><p>Kimmel's act is really gross and racist.</p>— Cernovich (@Cernovich) <a href=#>June 23, 2020</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>We get a night full of Jimmy Kimmel lecturing conservatives.</p><p>Yes, this Jimmy Kimmel of Karl Malone blackface fame <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HRa8oN8IQh</a></p>— Comfortably Smug (@ComfortablySmug) <a href=#>March 5, 2018</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kimmel wore blackface and mocked NBA legend Karl Malone as if he were an unintelligent animal.</p><p>Now, after backlash, he's tucking tail and running away.

One such video was an interview with Megan Fox in 2009 on his show Jimmy Kimmel Live! where the actress revealed how director Michael Bay went for an objectified visualization of her when she auditioned to be an extra in his film Bad Boys II at the age of 15.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>He made her “dance underneath a waterfall” in a bikini, which as Fox highlighted, was the “microcosm of how Bay’s mind works.” Kimmel, instead of being sensitive and understanding the gravity of Fox’s revelation, quipped that what Bay did was “really a microcosm of how all our minds works, but some of us have the decency to repress those thoughts and pretend that they don’t exist.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>After the video resurfaced, Megan Fox fans thrashed Kimmel on Twitter and demanded that he apologize to the actress. Even if the host had planned to address the issue, the topic came to a halt after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the actress came forward to defend Bay</a> and claimed that he “never assaulted or preyed upon in what I felt was a sexual manner.”</p><h2 id=h-landing-in-trouble-for-his-killing-everyone-in-china-skit data-injectable=false>Landing in trouble for his “killing everyone in China” skit</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Post the airing of an episode of his show in 2013, Jimmy Kimmel attracted the ire of many, including Chinese-American groups who carried out multiple protests, and a White House petition — signed by over 100,000 people — demanding an apology from the host and ABC network.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>The clip in question depicted children, aged 5 and 6, on an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! They were questioned by the comedian to think of ways to pay back the debt of $1.3 trillion dollars America owed to China. One boy pitched the suggestion to “shoot cannons all the way over and kill everyone in China,” which Kimmel called an “interesting idea.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false>He then proceeded to pose the question whether “we allow the Chinese to live,” thus prompting one of the kids to chime in with a “No” while others said yes.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>The segment soon triggered a massive controversy, pushing ABC to publish an apology assuring that they never intended to “upset” any community. Kimmel also apologized though he stressed that “it was obvious that I didn’t agree with that statement, but apparently it wasn’t.”</p><h2 id=h-getting-labeled-as-a-bully-after-he-made-joaquin-phoenix-uncomfortable data-injectable=false>Getting labeled as a “bully” after he made Joaquin Phoenix uncomfortable</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=575 data-current-count=875 data-injectable=true>When Joaquin Phoenix appeared on Kimmel’s show to do the promotions of his film, Joker, the host played a behind-the-scenes outtake of the actor on the sets of the film chewing out cinematographer Lawrence Sher. As described by Phoenix’s publicist, the video was a “joke outtake.” But the fact that the actor looked visibly awkward after the video was played and stressed that the video was supposed to be “personal” didn’t really give the whole interview — which included other instances of Kimmel making fun of The Village star — any humorous vibes.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=168 data-injectable=false>Phoenix’s fans were quick to come to his defense and didn’t waste any time berating Kimmel for “bullying” the actor by constantly making him feel awkward.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>I always assumed(knew) he was a bully but the recent interview with Joaquin Phoenix just confirmed it</p>— ✟𝕯𝖆𝖍𝖛𝖎𝖊 De Chanel✟ (@Dahvies_Life) <a href=#>October 11, 2019</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>For reaaaal.

During the episode, Park excitedly revealed how after BTS shared her cover of their famous song, “Dynamite,” she experienced a major brain fog, which she initially attributed to the shock she felt after Namjoon and Taehyung posted her song. But the next day she discovered that the extreme symptoms were the result of her having COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=151 data-current-count=151 data-injectable=false>In response to her anecdote, Kimmel said: “You thought it was BTS fever.
